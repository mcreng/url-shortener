# url-shortener
This is a web application that provides url shortening services. I intend to learn more about front-end and back-end development through this project.

This project uses:
- ReactJS and AntDesign as front-end
- NodeJS, mySQL, express, knex as back-end

To run `url-shortener`,
- Install npm using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
- Fix an issue (that happens to me) by referencing [here](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8360).
- Head to root and run
```npm install``` to install required dependencies.
- Start by 
```npm start```.
